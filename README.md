# Class12CapstoneExample

The final product must be submitted, including complete source code, documentation, analysis, and so on, as appropriate for the project.  To be considered complete, the student must submit the following artifacts in GitHub as part of their capstone:  
Test cases (at least 10) and test plan.*  
Test Execution results from the test plan. At least 1 run of all test cases.  
Defects.**  
Demonstrable use of at least 3 tools to assist in testing.  
At least 2 tests against the GUI, at least 2 tests targeting the API layer.  
At lease 2 test cases automated and executed using automation.  
Demonstration of a specific testing activity not taught in class.***  
  
  
  
  
* 10 is the minimum, you're welcome to do more.  
Of the 10, it's broken down like this:  
- 3 test cases that use a tool tool taught in class.  
- 2 tests against the GUI  
- 2 tests targeting the API layer  
- 2 test cases automated and executed using automation  
- 1 freestyle (your choice).  
- X test cases outside of the 10 to demonstrate your mastery and knowledge of your topic for Self Learning.  
  
  
** At least 1.  But there are several to be found and you want to prove you can find and document defects.  
  
*** The idea is that you will pick an area of testing you are interested in, and then learn about it and create a way to test it. So for example, if you are interested in security testing, load testing, ADA testing, database testing, or some other testing, then you choose one, then figure out how to construct tests to show you understand the type of testing you are doing, the test cases you used to "explore" that type of testing, and then your findings (and you will present to class as part of the oral presentation). Functional testing in and of itself doesn't count, since that is what you are effectively doing in the rest of the required test cases. If you want to learn a tool, then it should bring a specific type of testing to the picture (for example ZAP for security testing); Learning a tool to do alternate functional testing wont cut it unless there is a new angle to be explored. This is intended to be significantly (as in meaningful) NEW testing with its own test cases (a few at least) to explore the topic beyond the 10 required testcases (which are then broken into GUI, API, Automated, etc).    
  
  
This is an example layout of the expected artifacts of your Capstone
